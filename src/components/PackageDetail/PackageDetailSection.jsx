          Dream Big, Apply Smarter – Unlock Your Future with FuNglish’s Dual
          Track Package
        </p>

        <p>
          Are you concerned about the declining U.S. F-1 visa approval rates and
          worried about relying on only one country?
        </p>

        <p>
          Do you feel uncertain whether German universities will accept your
          academic background?
        </p>

        <p>
          Are you interested in studying in the UK but unsure how to begin the
          application process?
        </p>

        <p>
          Do you fear wasting both time and money if one country rejects your
          application and you have to start over in another
        </p>

        <p>
          FuNglish’s Dual Track Package is designed to solve these challenges.
        </p>

        <p>What is the Dual Track Package?</p>

        <p>
          The Dual Track Package allows you to apply to two countries at the
          same time—U.S., Germany, and the UK (any two of your choice). This
          means fewer risks, more opportunities, and greater chances of success.
        </p>

        <p>Our package includes:</p>

        <p>
          If you apply to the U.S., FuNglish will also apply to the UK for you
          free of charge.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you apply to the UK, FuNglish will also apply to the U.S. for you
          free of charge.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you apply to Germany, FuNglish will also apply to the UK for you
          free of charge. If you apply to Germany, FuNglish will also apply to
          the U.S. for you free of charge.
        </p>

        <p>
          You can also apply to both the U.S. and Germany together at a
          cost-effective rate.
        </p>

        <p>
          Beyond university applications, the package covers complete visa
          process management. For the U.S., this includes DS-160 form completion
          and visa interview training directly with FuNglish Founder, Tr. Pinky,
          along with practice sessions guided by a native teacher
        </p>

        <h1>Benefits of the Dual Track Package</h1>

        <p>
          Save Time: Since you apply to two countries simultaneously, you won’t
          need to restart the process if one application is rejected
        </p>

        <p>
          Save Costs: By applying to the U.S. or Germany, you get the UK
          application free of charge. You only pay service fees equivalent to
          one country but apply to two.
        </p>

        <p>
          Increase Success Rate: Applying to two countries at once improves your
          chances of receiving a visa.
        </p>

        <p>
          Professional Guidance: Our experienced teachers personally assist with
          university and visa applications, ensuring a structured and reliable
          process.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you are planning to apply to universities in the U.S., UK, or
          Germany, and want a cost-effective, time-saving service with expert
          interview preparation strategies, the FuNglish Dual Track Package is
          the right choice.

    title: "IELTS Preparation + Scholarship Mentoring Program",
    text: (
      <div className="">
        <p>
          At FuNglish, we understand that studying abroad with a scholarship is
          the dream of many students. However, applying for scholarships often
          comes with challenges such as:
        </p>

        <p>
          Not knowing which program to apply for or how to prepare the required
          documents.
        </p>

        <p>
          Facing difficulties because of the mandatory standardized test—IELTS.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since scholarships are highly competitive and awarded to the most
          outstanding students, it is crucial to prepare strong documents,
          demonstrate language proficiency, and ensure there are no weak points
          in your application. Achieving a solid IELTS Band Score is also an
          essential requirement for most scholarships
        </p>

        <p>
          That is why FuNglish has designed a unique, value-added package that
          combines IELTS preparation with scholarship mentoring. This package
